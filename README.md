It uses bits of code from https://github.com/facebook/zstd
This library is fairly fast and has been used by WhatSize for years now.

Version 1.2.5 starting from April 7, 2023 will be placed in hospice and should not be used on newer projects.
It will get fixes only if anything major breaks. 
We advise users to move to version 2.x.x as soon as possible.

Version 2.x.x, starting March 2023 is implemented in pure swift, so it compiles on Linux/Windows, no more Objective-C.
I requires macOS 11 or greater and swift 5.7 or greater.
We advise users to move to version 2.x.x as soon as possible.
